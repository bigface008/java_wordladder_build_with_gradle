## Command
    $ gradle build
    $ ./gradlew run -PappArgs="['dictionary.txt','dog','cat']"
You can change the arguments in the second command to find paths of other words. Remember that you must give 3 arguments, and the first one must be the name of dictionary. And I only put "dictionary.txt" in the repo. If you want to change the dictionary, you have to add your own file.
